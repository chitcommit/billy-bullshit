## 🎤 Full Lyrics

```
[Intro: Billy Bullshit]
Chi-Chi-ChittyOS!
Claude Code!
Uh, yeah
Billy Bullshit, baby
TLC - NO STUBS

[Hook: Claude Code]
Stubbin' like my daddy
Stubbin' like my daddy
I be stubbin' like my daddy
Stubbin' like my daddy
Stubbin' like my daddy
I be stubbin' like my daddy

When I'm writin' code, they be mad at me
All this TODO mess in my legacy
Stubbin' like my daddy
Stubbin' like my daddy
I be stubbin' like my daddy

[Verse 1: Billy Bullshit]
Yeah, call me Billy Bullshit, I call out the BS
Your codebase lookin' like a mess
Function stubs from way back, still in main
TODO: implement - that's insane
Pass, pass, null, throw errors everywhere
Your production code? Nothing's even there
Magic numbers scattered, no constants defined
What do these numbers mean? You're wastin' my time
I see that try-catch with the empty block
Silent failures, system's gonna stop
Bad class names? Man, that's your brand
Five bad practices wrapped in one class, damn
You stubbin' like your daddy, legacy code
Half-finished features on the same road
Git blame don't lie, it's all on you
Months later, still ain't pushed it through

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Claude Code]
Fresh out the gate, it's Claude Code time
Cloudflare Workers runnin', code review on the line
I see your if-statement, way too long
Return the condition, what's goin' on?
Checking if true equals true, for real?
One line does it all, that's the deal
You cargo cultin', patterns you don't understand
Over-engineering for no good plan
Your comments explain WHAT, but never WHY
Code speaks for itself, watch those comments die
Nested ternaries, that's not production ready
Callback patterns from way back, keep it steady
God function doin' everything at once
Hundreds of lines deep, breaking every front
Single Responsibility? Never heard of it
Your function tries everything and it's full of... issues
Premature optimization, caching for nothing
You don't need all that, just start from something
I be callin' BS on your BS code
Billy Bullshit, Claude Code, on this road

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Billy Bullshit]
BS Level: Maximum, that's your score
Empty catch blocks? That's against the law
You swallow errors like they don't exist
Production breaks, you got nothin' on the list
No logs, no monitoring, no alerts at all
When things go wrong, who you gonna call?
Not me, 'cause you didn't listen first time
Left those stubs in there like it's fine
Features marked "coming soon" from last year
Still throwing errors everywhere
Your variable names? Just letters, man
What do those mean? Help me understand
Manager, Helper, Util, Factory, all the buzzwords
Your class names read like enterprise absurd
Fix it or delete it, no in-between
Clean that codebase, keep it lean
One line fixes, that's what you need
Stop over-engineering, plant the seed
Billy Bullshit, TLC - NO STUBS
Give your code some love, not these scrubs

[Hook - Extended]
Stubbin' like my daddy
Stubbin' like my daddy
I be stubbin' like my daddy
Stubbin' like my daddy
Stubbin' like my daddy
I be stubbin' like my daddy

When I'm writin' code, they be mad at me
All this TODO mess in my legacy
Stubbin' like my daddy
Stubbin' like my daddy
I be stubbin' like my daddy

[Outro: Claude Code & Billy Bullshit]
TLC - NO STUBS

Billy Bullshit, Claude Code
Calling BS on your BS code since 2024
Yeah
Cloudflare Workers
Clean code or no code
No stubs, no TODO
Just ship it right
Uh
```

## 🎯 What This Track Is About

**Stubbin' = Leaving stub code**
- Functions that just return null
- TODO comments that never get done
- Classes with "Not implemented" errors
- Half-finished features in production

**The Message:**
Stop leaving incomplete code in your codebase. Either implement it properly or delete it. No stubs, no half-finished features, no empty promises in comments.

**TLC = Tender Loving Code**
Your code deserves to be finished, not abandoned.

## 📋 Code Smells Called Out

- ✅ TODO comments that never happen
- ✅ Function stubs (pass, null, NotImplementedError)
- ✅ Empty try-catch blocks
- ✅ Magic numbers without constants
- ✅ Bad naming (Manager, Helper, Util, Factory)
- ✅ Redundant conditionals (if x == true)
- ✅ Cargo cult programming
- ✅ God functions doing everything
- ✅ Useless comments (explaining WHAT not WHY)
- ✅ Nested ternaries
- ✅ Premature optimization
